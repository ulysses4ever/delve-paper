\begin{abstract}
The current approach to building data analysis applications is dominated by
imperative languages armed with robust libraries for typical data processing
tasks. Both imperative features and APIs pose well-known challenges that can
be avoided if a declarative domain-specific language for data manipulation is
employed. In this paper, we showcase a commercial implementation of Datalog
embedded in Julia, called Delve, that has a number of plummy features: it is
declarative, has virtually zero amount of API vocabulary required to apply it,
and can resort to the efficient JIT compiler of Julia for the tasks not
amenable for declarative processing. We discuss two implementations of a data
processing application, using Delve and R, and compare them along two axes:
linguistics and performance.


%The abstract should briefly summarize the contents of the paper in
%150--250 words.
